### Fetching the latest version of Alpine as a base image: ###
As per [medium] (https://medium.com/swlh/alpine-slim-stretch-buster-jessie-bullseye-bookworm-what-are-the-differences-in-docker-62171ed4531d), Alpine images contain a Linux based operation system that was designed specifically to be used inside containers. Furthermore, the main advantage of alpine images is their tiny size and the ability to add further functionality e.g. BusyBox at a later point in time through a Dockerfile.

As per [java4coding] (https://www.java4coding.com/contents/docker/docker-from-command) the docker FROM command can be used to retrieve a base image from Docker Hub that can be utilised by the build process. Furthermore by specifying 'latest' as the releasetag, the latest available build of Alpine will be retrieved.

As per [dockerDocumentation] (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from) a name can be assigned to this stage of the build process which can be subsequently referenced through the use of AS.

### Downloading the BusyBox binaries: ###
As per [linuxhandbook] (https://linuxhandbook.com/what-is-busybox/), BusyBox contains a bare bones implementation of the most used UNIX/Linux commands along with a terminal to issue such commands. Like Alpine, it has a very small footprint in terms of its size.

As per [linuxize] (https://linuxize.com/post/wget-command-examples/), the wget command can be used to download files through the command line using the HTTP protocol.

In this case, an archive will be received which as per [linuxize] (https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-extract-unzip-tar-gz-file/), can be unarchived using the tar command. The flag '-x' denotes the extraction option and the name of the archive should follow the 'f' flag. As per [geeksforgeeks] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mv-command-linux-examples/#:~:text=mv%20stands%20for%20move.,a%20file%20system%20like%20UNIX.), we can use the mv command to "to move one or more files or directories from one place to another in a file system like UNIX". In this case we are moving the extracted files to the '/busybox' directory.

As per in [java4coding] (https://www.java4coding.com/contents/docker/docker-run-command), the docker RUN command can be used to execute Linux commands from a terminal.

### Creating a new user to secure running commands: ###
As per [unix] (https://www.unix.com/man-page/minix/8/adduser/), the adduser command adds a new user to a system by appending a new entrie to '/etc/passwd' and creating a new home directory for our user i.e. '/home/static'. As per [linux] (https://linux.die.net/man/8/adduser), the -D flag denotes to use this default behaviour.

***
### Retrieving the content of my website from GitHub: ###
As per Downloading the BusyBox binaries, the wget command can be used to download files.

In this case, an archive will be received which can be unarchived using the tar command. As per [geeksforgeeks] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rm-command-linux-examples/), we can use the rm command to delete files, in this case the downloaded archive. As per [geeksforgeeks] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mv-command-linux-examples/#:~:text=mv%20stands%20for%20move.,a%20file%20system%20like%20UNIX.), we can use the mv command to "to move one or more files or directories from one place to another in a file system like UNIX". In this case we are moving an extracted folder i.e. webdev_CA1-main to the '/home/static' directory. This folder contains the content of my website.

### Changing working directory to /busybox: ###
As per [java4coding] (https://www.java4coding.com/contents/docker/docker-workdir-command), the docker WORKDIR command can be used to navigate to a working directory.

***
### Installing a custom version of BusyBox: ###
As per [justsomedevnotes] (https://justsomedevnotes.com/2020/11/30/linux-busybox-http-server/), the BusyBox httpd service can be used to serve static website content.

As per [blog] (https://lipanski.com/posts/smallest-docker-image-static-website), BusyBox consists of many more services than just httpd hence "we can create a custom build of BusyBox limiting it to only httpd and thus reducing its size". This can be achieved using the '.config' file contained within [repo] (https://github.com/lipanski/docker-static-website). As per [educba] (https://www.educba.com/docker-copy-command/), the docker COPY command can be used to copy files or folders from a docker host i.e. a local machine to a container's filesystem. As per [educative] (https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-use-copy-in-docker), the "syntax of the the COPY command is: COPY <src> <dest>".

As per [thoughtbot] (https://thoughtbot.com/blog/the-magic-behind-configure-make-make-install), we can use the make command in conjunction with the config file and the BusyBox binaries to compile our customised version of Busybox and then use the make install command to "copy the built program, and its libraries and documentation, to the correct location(s)" which in this case as per [blog] (https://lipanski.com/posts/smallest-docker-image-static-website) is '_install/bin/busybox'.

***
### Switching to the scratch image: ###
As per [devopsschool] (https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/creating-a-simple-parent-base-docker-image-using-scratch/), "you can use Dockerâ€™s reserved, minimal image, scratch, as a starting point for building containers" as this image is in fact completely empty thereby providing you with the smallest base image possible.

***
### Exposing container port 8080: ###
As per [java4coding] (https://www.java4coding.com/contents/docker/docker-volume-expose-command#DockerExpose), the docker EXPOSE command is used to expose a container's port to the outside world.

***
### Copying user and custom BusyBox version to the scratch image: ###
As previously mentioned, when we added our new user i.e. static to builder their details were added to the '/etc/passwd' file.  We can now use the Docker COPY command to copy this details over to our scratch image as well as copying over a custom version of BusyBox. As per [stackoverflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66353510/what-is-from-used-in-copy-command-in-dockerfile#:~:text=%22You%20can%20use%20the%20COPY,copies%20the%20artifact%20from%20there.%22), we can use the --from flag to copy from a seperate image, in our case builder. As per [dockerDocumentation] (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy), we can set <src> to a previous build stage using the syntax '--from=<name>'.
